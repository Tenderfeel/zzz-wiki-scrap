# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature standardizes the frost attribute naming in the ZZZ character data processing system by changing `frostAttribute` to `frost` in the Stats type definition. This change aligns with the existing naming convention used for other attributes like `ice`, `fire`, `electric`, etc., and ensures consistency across the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with the ZZZ character data system, I want the frost attribute to be named consistently as `frost` instead of `frostAttribute`, so that it follows the same naming pattern as other attributes and improves code readability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Stats type is defined THEN it SHALL use `frost` instead of `frostAttribute`
2. WHEN existing code references `frostAttribute` THEN it SHALL be updated to use `frost`
3. WHEN the attribute mapping logic processes frost attributes THEN it SHALL correctly handle the `frost` value
4. WHEN tests validate attribute types THEN they SHALL pass with the new `frost` naming

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the codebase, I want all references to the frost attribute to be consistently updated, so that there are no broken references or inconsistencies in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching the codebase for `frostAttribute` THEN no references SHALL remain
2. WHEN the system processes character data with frost attributes THEN it SHALL work correctly with the new naming
3. WHEN type checking is performed THEN all frost attribute references SHALL be valid
4. WHEN existing data files reference frost attributes THEN they SHALL be compatible with the new naming

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the API mapping functionality, I want the Japanese to English attribute mapping to correctly handle frost attributes, so that data processing continues to work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Japanese attribute data contains frost-related values THEN they SHALL be mapped to `frost`
2. WHEN the mapping logic processes frost attributes THEN it SHALL use the standardized `frost` name
3. WHEN validation occurs on processed data THEN frost attributes SHALL pass type checking
4. WHEN generating output files THEN frost attributes SHALL be correctly represented
