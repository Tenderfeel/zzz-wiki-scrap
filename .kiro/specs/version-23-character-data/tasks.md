# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Verify version 2.3 character data availability in Scraping.md

    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

  - [x] 2.2 Extend DataProcessor with generic partial data processing logic
    - Add missing field detection logic to DataProcessor
    - Implement graceful degradation for any missing non-essential fields
    - Add detailed logging for partial data processing steps
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 3. Extend CharacterGenerator for partial data handling

  - [x] 3.1 Add support for generating Character objects from partial data

    - Modify generateCharacter method to handle missing fields gracefully
    - Implement validation logic for partial character data
    - Add fallback mechanisms for any character with missing data
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

  - [x] 3.2 Update character validation to support partial data requirements
    - Extend validateCharacter method to handle partial data scenarios
    - Add configurable validation rules for characters with missing fields
    - Implement appropriate error messages for missing data scenarios
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 4. Update batch processing logic to handle version 2.3 characters

  - Modify batch processor to include lucia, manato, yidhari in processing queue
  - Ensure proper error isolation between characters during batch processing
  - Verify that existing Scraping.md-based character discovery includes the new characters
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Integrate version 2.3 characters into existing data generation pipeline

  - [x] 5.1 Update main processing pipeline to include new characters

    - Modify main processing scripts to include lucia, manato, yidhari in character processing
    - Ensure proper API request handling for new pageIds (907, 908, 909)
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

  - [x] 5.2 Update characters.ts output generation
    - Ensure new characters are properly added to existing characters.ts export
    - Maintain existing TypeScript export format and type safety
    - Verify proper integration with existing character data
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Add comprehensive error handling and logging

  - [x] 6.1 Implement detailed logging for partial data character processing

    - Add specific log messages for each character processing step
    - Implement warning logs for any character data deficiencies
    - Add success/failure tracking for each character
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

  - [x] 6.2 Add error recovery mechanisms
    - Implement retry logic for API failures specific to version 2.3 characters
    - Add graceful degradation for partial processing failures
    - Ensure processing continues even if individual characters fail
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 7. Create comprehensive test suite for version 2.3 integration

  - [x] 7.1 Write unit tests for PartialDataHandler class

    - Test generic partial data error handling methods
    - Test empty value generation for missing fields
    - Test partial character data validation with various scenarios
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

  - [x] 7.2 Write integration tests for version 2.3 character processing

    - Test end-to-end processing of lucia, manato, yidhari
    - Test error scenarios and graceful degradation
    - Test integration with existing character data
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

  - [x] 7.3 Write validation tests for generated character data
    - Test Character object structure and type compliance
    - Test required field presence and empty value application
    - Test characters.ts output format and integration
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
